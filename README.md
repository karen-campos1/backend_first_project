## Features

- **Mark Task as Complete**: Mark tasks as done and move them to the completed tasks list.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks from either the to-do list or the completed tasks list.

## Usage

1. **Add a Task**:
   - Select option 1 from the menu.
   - Enter the task you want to add when prompted.

2. **View your current 'To Do List' and your Completed-Task**:
   - Select option 2 from the menu.   

3. **Mark a Task as Complete**:
   - Select option 3 from the menu.
   - Choose the task you want to mark as done from the displayed to-do list.

4. **Delete a Task**:

## Notes

- Tasks are case-insensitive. For example, "task", "Task", and "TASK" are considered the same.
- Removing a task that does not exist in the list will result in a warning message.
- Completed tasks are stored separately from the to-do list.
- There is no option to save tasks permanently; they are stored only during runtime.
